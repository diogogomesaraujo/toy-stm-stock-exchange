= Concurrency and Locks

#slide(title: "Locks")[
  *Locks* or _mutexes_ give a necessary but *"pessimistic"* boudary for *data integrity* where:
  - *Critical sections* where shared data is accessed are isolation through a *lock-based system*;
  - It is the programmer's task to identify and anotate such sections;

  Though simple, locks come with limitations:
  - Overreliance on *mutual exclusion* imposes a rigid *sequential bottleneck*;
  - Concurrent programs relying on locks are *not trivially composable* into larger ones;
  - Naive implementations may result in *resource starvation*, namely _deadlocks_, *priority inversion* and *kernel-level thread suspension*;

#slide(title: "Locks on a stock exchange's order book")[
  An unwise approach for modeling concurrent access in an imperative programming language, such as _Rust_, using locks as the primary synchronization primitive would be:

  ```Rust
  struct OrderBook<Order> {
    bid_orders: Arc<Mutex<PriorityQueue<Order>>>,
    ask_orders: Arc<Mutex<PriorityQueue<Order>>>,
  }
  ```

  May cause a deadlock if concurrent access is not well though out:
  ```Rust
  if let Ok(mut bid_orders) = order_book.bid_orders.lock() {
      bid_orders.insert(order);

      let lowest_ask = order_book.ask_orders.lock()?.remove();
      ...
  }
  ```

= Transactional Memory (TM)

#focus-slide[
  _"A transaction is a finite sequence of local and shared memory machine instructions"_
]

#slide(title: "Hardware Transactional Memory")[
  In Transactional Memory (TM):
  - Database operations are handled through sequences of `read_transactional` `write_transactional` instructions that compose a transaction;
  - Each transaction either *terminates successfully*, when all operations occur, updating the *shared memory state*, or *aborts* and is re-queued for later execution when one or more fail to run;
  - A *transactional cache* stores writes temporarily until a `commit` or `abort` instruction was called.

  Though simple, this model allows for implementing *non-blocking* and *lock-free* concurrent access to shared data structures.
]

#slide(title: "Hardware Transactional Memory")[
  Comes with its own set of limitations:
  - Requires *hardware-specific synchronization mechanisms* to create lock-free shared memory locations on multiprocessor systems;
  - If a transaction's dataset *exceeded the size of the cache*, it unavoidably leads to *abortion*.
]

= Software Transactional Memory (STM)

#slide(title: "Software Transactional Memory (STM)")[
  STM expands upon this framework by providing a software-based abstraction for managing concurrent access to shared memory without relying on hardware support.

  In STM:
  - A thread executes a transaction *in isolation*, on a *local copy* of the shared memory
  - If no other thread has written to the same memory addresses during execution, the changes are *committed*, otherwise, the transaction is *aborted*;
  - The reader is tasked with re-evaluating data consistency after executing an atomic instruction sequence;

  By treating memory operations as *atomic transactions* rather than protected critical sections, STM *mitigates the risks* of *priority inversion* and *deadlock*.
]

#slide(title: "How STM relates with Functional Programming")[
  Since transactions encapsulate effects within an ephemeral log, they behave as first-class
  values that can be sequenced, combined, and passed as arguments before any effect is committed to shared
  state.
]

#slide(title: "STM Monad")[
  Transactions, in Haskell, are composed using the STM monad, provided by `Control.Concurrent.STM`. A transactional variable of type `TVar` can be atomically mutated and read through sequences of `readTVar` and `writeTVar` operations:

  ```Haskell
  readTVar  :: TVar a -> STM a
  writeTVar :: TVar a -> a -> STM ()
  ```

  As such, transactions are composed into pure `STM` values and only executed when lifted into `IO`, using the `atomically` operator defined by the following type:

  ```Haskell
  atomically :: STM a -> IO a
  ```
  This mechanism ensures that all transactional actions are *executed atomically*, meaning that *intermediate states are never observable* by other threads.
]

= A Transactional Order Book

#slide(title: "Modeling a transactional order book")[
  The design of a stock exchange order book is a natural application of STM, as it involves frequent concurrent modifications to shared state under strict consistency requirements.

  A transacitonal order book could be implemented as:

  ```Haskell
  data TOrderBook c = TOrderBook { bidOrders :: TPriorityQueue (Order c),
                                   askOrders :: TPriorityQueue (Order c),
                                   clock     :: TVar (Timestamp) }
  ```

  Unlike a lock-based design, *no explicit synchronisation primitives* guard this state.

  Instead, the *runtime detects conflicts dynamically* and *retries computations* as needed, without programmer intervention.
]

#slide(title: "Modeling a transactional order book")[
  Each order pairs a header with a timestamp. The header encodes whether the order is a buy or sell request and its associated limit price:

  ```Haskell
  data OrderType = Buy | Sell
      deriving (Show, Eq)

  data Header c = Header { limitAmount :: c,
                           orderType   :: OrderType }

  data Order c = Order { header    :: Header c,
                         timestamp :: Timestamp }
  ```
]

#slide(title: "Modeling a transactional order book")[
  We derive an `Ord` instance to ensure that better-priced orders are prioritized, with ties resolved in FIFO order through timestamps:

  ```Haskell
  instance Ord c => Ord (Order c) where
      compare ordA ordB =
      compare (limitAmount $ header ordA, timestamp ordA)
          (limitAmount $ header ordB, timestamp ordB)
  ```

  To preserve *global ordering consistency*, we assign each order a *timestamp atomically* inside the `STM` context:
  ```Haskell
  stamp :: Ord c => TOrderBook c -> Header c -> STM (Order c)
  stamp ordBook h = do
      ts    <- readTVar $ clock ordBook
      _     <- writeTVar (clock ordBook) (ts + 1)
      return $ newOrder h ts
  ```
]

#slide(title: "Modeling a transactional order book")[
  Initialization creates empty transactional priority queues alongside a fresh clock, composing naturally within the `STM` monad:
  ```Haskell
  newTOrderBook :: Ord c => STM (TOrderBook c)
  newTOrderBook = do
      bidOrds <- newTPriorityQueue
      askOrds <- newTPriorityQueue
      clk     <- newTVar 0
      return   $ TOrderBook { clock     = clk,
                              bidOrders = bidOrds,
                              askOrders = askOrds }
  ```
]

#slide(title: "Modeling a transactional order book")[
  *Timestamp assignment* and *queue insertion* are merged into a *single transaction*, ensuring intermediate states are *never visible* to other threads:
  ```Haskell
  addTOrderBook :: Ord c => Header c -> TOrderBook c -> STM ()
  addTOrderBook hd ordBook = do
      ord <- stamp ordBook hd
      case orderType hd of
          Buy  -> insertTPriorityQueue ord (bidOrders ordBook)
          Sell -> insertTPriorityQueue ord (askOrders ordBook)

  removeTOrderBook :: Ord c => OrderType -> TOrderBook c -> STM (Maybe (Order c))
  removeTOrderBook t ordBook = case t of
      Buy  -> pollTPriorityQueue $ bidOrders ordBook
      Sell -> pollTPriorityQueue $ askOrders ordBook
  ```
